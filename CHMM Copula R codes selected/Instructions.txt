1. Data file is given in .csv format
   Use "Data set up" to read and reformat the "data.csv". The codes are specific for this file.

2. Forward-backward functions should be run separately
3. Initial parameters setting can be done in several ways: 
                             a) Initial setup 1
                             b) Initial setup 2
                             c) Custom defined initial parameters

4. CHMM VEM: includes main VEM algorithm based on Forward-backward functions 
                       and the selected initial paramaters settings
5. CHMM VEM can be implemented for Geometric or Binomial Copula. Mainly the codes are written for Binomial Copula
6. For now, CHMM VEM works for Poisson distribution.

7. Outputs are estimated parameters of the model, error values
